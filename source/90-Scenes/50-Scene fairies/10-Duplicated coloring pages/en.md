# Why is each coloring page duplicated?

Each of the [coloring pages from the „{=property(scene-translated)}” scene](https://scanarium.com/#pdfs-fairies) is available in two variants:

{=macro(zoomable-image-left, images/flower-fairy-normal.jpg, Blumenfee)} The „normal” variant comes with only few lines on the inside.
This variant provides much room for your own ideas and details.
{: class=clearfix}

Some kids prefer coloring pages with more details fixed.
Just like in a coloring book.

{=macro(zoomable-image-left, images/flower-fairy-detailed.jpg, Blumenfee)} That's why each coloring page also comes in a "detailed" variant, with more pre-drawn details and more lines on the inside.

There you'll find for example a more detailed face, accessoires like a belt around the waist, or patterns in the wings.

You can download both variants directly in the <a href="https://scanarium.com/#pdfs-fairies">{=property(scene-translated)} part of the PDF section</a> on the homepage.
