# {=property(scene-translated)}

{=macro(scene-header-localized, balloons and birds)}

Your balloons slowly and piecefully float across the sky and the wind gently blows at them.

And if you're after a bit more action, color and upload a few birds.
They enter the scene from the sides and if their beaks hit a balloon, then *PANG!* the balloon pops.
