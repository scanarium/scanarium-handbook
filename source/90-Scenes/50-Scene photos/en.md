There are coloring pages of just empty photo frames that you can fill with whatever you want.
But there are also coloring pages with photos of people or settings.
For example a photo of you and a friend.
Or of you on top of a tower in a castle ruin.
Of you after driving a racing car.
Of you riding a unicorn.

Scanarium arranges your photos into a photo wall that scrolls by.
