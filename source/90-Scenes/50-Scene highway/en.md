# {=property(scene-translated)}

{=macro(scene-header-localized, different vehicles)}

From cars, and sports cars over quad bikes, and tractors to trucks, and buses up to emergency vehicles.

Your vehicles dash (or go or for some rather "crawl") across one of three highways.

The emergency vehicles sometimes have their beacons on, and sometimes have them off.
