# Coloring

As long as the paper does not end up too curly or too wavy (e.g., due to being soaked), you can color the {=macro(labeled-node-link, scanarium-coloring-pages, Scanarim coloring pages)} using any {=macro(labeled-node-link, pens, pencils, pens, crayons, or colors you like)}.

For example colored pencils and felt-tip pens work really well.

But you can also explore your crafty side and combine the coloring pages with {=macro(labeled-node-link, photos, real photos)} or add {=macro(labeled-node-link, objects, figures, toys and other objects)} before taking the photos.
