# Can I add real photos?

Of course!

Photos, drawings, paintings, cutouts, ….
You can add to or decorate Scanarium coloring pages in whatever way you like.

There are no limits as long as the {=macro(labeled-node-link, rectangle, black bounding rectangle)} and the {=macro(labeled-node-link, qr-code, QR code)} stay visible.

* Find something to put onto the Scanarium coloring page.
    In this example, we'll add these four photos:

    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, images/coloring-photos-photos.jpg, Photos to add to a Scanarium coloring page)}
{: class=clearfix}

* Glue or put them onto the colored page (or cut holes and put them under the page):

    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, images/coloring-photos-drawing.jpg, Photos under coloring page)}
{: class=clearfix}

* Take a picture of the coloring page und upload it to Scanarium

    Now off go the rockets, cars, balloons, … with your photos!

    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, images/coloring-photos-screenshot.jpg, Photos in Scanarium)}
{: class=clearfix}
