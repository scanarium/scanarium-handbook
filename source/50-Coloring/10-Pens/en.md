# Which pens/colors can I use?

You can color with any pencils, pens, crayons, chalk, or whatever you like.

The following typically work very well:

* Colored pencils,
* Felt-tip pens,
* Gel pens,
* Glitter pens, and
* Crayons.

Watercolors and fingerpaint can work too.
But when painting too wet, the paper might curl up or get wavy, which can {=macro(labeled-node-link, takepicture, get in the way)} later during {=macro(labeled-node-link, scanning, upload)}.

We prefer to color with:

* Colored pencils (e.g., [Jolly Supersticks](https://jolly.at/en/produkt-kategorie/colouring-pencils/supersticks-classic/)), and

* Felt-tip pens (e.g., [Stabilo Cappi](https://www.stabilo.com/com/products/coloring-drawing/coloring-felt-tip-pens/stabilo-cappi/) und [Power](https://www.stabilo.com/com/products/coloring-drawing/coloring-felt-tip-pens/stabilo-power/) oder [Staedtler Noris Doppelfasermaler](https://www.staedtler.com/intl/en/products/products-for-colouring/fibre-tip-pens/noris-320-double-ended-fibre-tip-pen-320-nwp12/)).
