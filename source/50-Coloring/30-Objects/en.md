# Can I add toys and objects?

Yes, you can!
Simply put them onto the coloring pages.

It works with small figures, small plush animals, cars, shells, pearls, coins, stickers, and all the rest of it.

* Find something that should go into Scanarium.
    It this example, we'll use a fuse bead heart:

    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Fuse bead heart to put onto coloring page, images/coloring-objects-object.jpg)}
{: class=clearfix}

* Put it onto a Scanarium coloring page:

    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Object on a Scanarium coloring page, images/coloring-objects-drawing.jpg)}
{: class=clearfix}

* Take care that the {=macro(labeled-node-link, rectangle, black bounding rectangle)} and the {=macro(labeled-node-link, qr-code, QR code)} are both still well visible and not occluded.

    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Object occludes black bounding rectangle, images/coloring-objects-rectangle-hidden.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Object occludes QR code, images/coloring-objects-qr-code-hidden.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Coloring page with well placed object, images/coloring-objects-ok.jpg)}
{: class=clearfix}

* Take a picture and upload it to your Scanarium:

    Now the rockets, cars, balloons, â€¦ race across your screen with your fuse beads design, your figure, or your toy:

    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Scanned fuse bead heart in Scanarium, images/coloring-objects-screenshot.jpg)}
{: class=clearfix}
