# Supported browsers

If possible, use *Chrome* as browser.
We use it for most of our testing.

But thanks to our testers, we know that Scanarium runs fine on at least the following other browers:

* Chrome
* Edge
* Firefox
* Opera
* Safari
* Silk
* Vivaldi

It should be possible to install one of these on all {=macro(labeled-node-link, supported-devices, current devices)}.

Probably, it'll work on other browsers as well.
Try it out and point your browser to our [demo page](https://demo.scanarium.com/).
If the demo page runs smoothly, playing should work fine too.
