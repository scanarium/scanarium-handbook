# Can I play on multiple devices at the same time?

Yes, that works wonderfully!

Simply log in with your username/password on each of your devices, and there you go.

Each device shows it's own Scanarium.

And if a new image gets uploaded on any of the devices, it'll automatically propagate to the other devices as well.

For example, you can use a smartphone to take pictures of colored pages and upload them while you use a bigger monitor or smart TV to watch the rockets, butterflies, cars, ... move around.

Of course, you can also play different scenes on different devices at the same time.
