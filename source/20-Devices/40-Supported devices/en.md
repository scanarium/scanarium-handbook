# Supported devices

On devices that are less than 5 years old and have access to the internet, Scanarium typically works just fine.

Regardless of whether it's a tablet, a smartphone, a PC, or a laptop.

Try it out: Open the [demo page](https://demo.scanarium.com/) on you device.
If the demo page runs smoothly, playing should work fine too :-)

During development we're currently testing on:

* Amazon Fire 7
* Amazon Fire 10 HD
* Motorola One Macro
* various PCs und Laptops

Besides the device itself, the used {=macro(labeled-node-link, supported-browsers, browser)} may make a difference.
With *Chrome* it typically works just fine.
