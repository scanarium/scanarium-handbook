# Error message: "{=translate({=property(error-message)})}"

If uploading fails because no {=macro(labeled-node-link, rectangle, black bounding rectangle)} was found, take a new picture and take care that:

* the {=macro(labeled-node-link, rectangle, black bounding rectangle)} is well visible (neither occluded nor cut off),

    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Black bounding rectangle is cut off, images/scanning-rectangle-cut-off.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Dogear occludes black bounding rectangle, images/scanning-dog-ear.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Object occludes black bounding rectangle, images/scanning-object-on-rectangle.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Black bounding rectangle is fully visible, images/scanning-ok.jpg)}
{: class=clearfix}

* the coloring page lies flat

    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Dogear stands up, images/scanning-dog-ear.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Coloring page is not flat, images/scanning-not-flat.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Coloring page lies flat, images/scanning-ok.jpg)}
{: class=clearfix}

* the image is taken straight from above.

    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Image taken from too far at the front, images/scanning-too-skew-front.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Image taken from too far on the right, images/scanning-too-skew-sideways.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Image taken straight from above, images/scanning-ok.jpg)}
{: class=clearfix}

Uploading this new image should work.

If it still does not work, please send us the image to {=macro(help-email-link)}
