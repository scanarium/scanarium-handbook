If uploading fails because no {=macro(labeled-node-link, qr-code, QR code)} was found, take a new picture and take care that:

* you use a {=macro(labeled-node-link, scanarium-coloring-pages, Scanarium coloring page)},

    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Kein Scanarium-Ausmalbild, images/scanning-foreign-page.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Gutes Foto eines Scanarium-Ausmalbilds, images/scanning-ok.jpg)}
{: class=clearfix}

* the image is eventy and well lit (not too dark and no hard shadows),

    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Image too dark, images/scanning-too-dark.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Image contains hard shadows, images/scanning-hard-shadows.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Evenly and well lit image, images/scanning-ok.jpg)}
{: class=clearfix}

* the image is not too shaky,

    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Too shaky, images/scanning-too-blurry.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Steady image, images/scanning-ok.jpg)}
{: class=clearfix}

* the {=macro(labeled-node-link, qr-code, QR code)} is well visible (neither occluded nor painted over),

    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, QR code is occluded, images/scanning-object-on-qr.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, QR code has been painted over, images/scanning-color-on-qr.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, QR code is well visible, images/scanning-ok.jpg)}
{: class=clearfix}

* the image is taken straight from above.

    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Image taken from too far at the front, images/scanning-too-skew-front.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Image taken from too far on the right, images/scanning-too-skew-sideways.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Image taken straight from above, images/scanning-ok.jpg)}
{: class=clearfix}

Uploading this new image should work.

If it still does not work, please send us the image to {=macro(help-email-link)}
