# How do I log out?

There's a menu item to log out:

1. Tap/click the screen.
1. Select the „{=translate(Settings)}” button in the top-right corner.
1. In the window that pops up, select „{=translate(method_name, logout)}”.

You're now logged out and get forwarded to the Scanarium Homepage.

To continue playing, simply {=macro(labeled-node-link, launching, log in)} again.
