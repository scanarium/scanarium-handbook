# What is Scanarium?

Scanarium is a _coloring game for young, creative kids, who like to draw or paint_.

It's perfect for kids from pre-kindergarten to early primary school.

Here's is how it works:

* You print a [Scanarium coloring page](https://scanarium.com/coloring-pages.html) and {=macro(labeled-node-link, coloring, color it)}.
* Then you {=macro(labeled-node-link, scanning, upload)} the colored page to Scanarium.
* And Scanarium [animates](https://demo.scanarium.com/) it for you.
