# How can I sign up?

We're still in test mode.
So you'll need an invitation code to sign up.
(If you do not have an invitation code, send us an email at {=macro(help-email-link)})

Signing up is easy:

* Go to the sign up page: {=macro(url, https://scanarium.com/signup.html, Sign up page)}
* Enter your invitation code, username and password.
* Read the {=macro(named-url, https://scanarium.com/privacy-policy.txt, {=translate(privacy policy)})} and {=macro(named-url, https://scanarium.com/terms-of-service.txt, {=translate(terms of service)})} documents, and check the checkboxes if you accept them.
* Hit the form's "{=translate(Sign up)}" button.
* Done.
