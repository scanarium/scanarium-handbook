# How can I start to play?

* {=macro(labeled-node-link, printing, Print)} a [Scanarium coloring page](https://scanarium.com/#pdfs)
* {=macro(labeled-node-link, coloring, Color)} it to your liking.
* Start {=macro(labeled-node-link, launching, your Scanarium)}.
* Tap/click on your screen and select "{=translate(Upload image)}" and {=macro(labeled-node-link, takepicture, take a photo)} of the colored page (either {=macro(labeled-node-link, uploading-tablet, directly from your tablet/smartphone)}, or {=macro(labeled-node-link, uploading-pc, upload an image file)} to Scanarium).

Then all you need to do is watch and enjoy ... and of course color more pages! :-)

Here's a video tutorial:
