# Where can I download Scanarium coloring pages?

You can download them for free in the [PDF section](https://scanarium.com/#pdfs) of the homepage.

There you'll not only find PDFs of the individual coloring pages, but also collections with more than one coloring page.

For example "[{=translate(All coloring pages)}](https://scanarium.com/pdfs/{=property(language)}/{=safeFilename({=translate(All coloring pages)})}.pdf)", or "[{=translate1Param(All {scene_name} coloring pages, scene_name, space)}](https://scanarium.com/pdfs/space/scene/{=property(language)}/{=safeFilename({=translate1Param(All {scene_name} coloring pages, scene_name, space)})}.pdf)".
