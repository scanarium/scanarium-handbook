# Printing

Any {=macro(labeled-node-link, printer, normal printer)} is enough to print {=macro(labeled-node-link, scanarium-coloring-pages, Scanarium coloring pages)}.

{=macro(labeled-node-link, printing-tips, Make sure)} that the printout is not too light and that the {=macro(labeled-node-link, rectangle, black bounding rectangle)} is not cut off.

If you {=macro(labeled-node-link, no-printer, do not have a printer)}, you can also color the images using a graphics program.
