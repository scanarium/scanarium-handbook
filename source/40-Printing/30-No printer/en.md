# Can I play without a printer?

In principle, you can color the {=macro(labeled-node-link, scanarium-coloring-pages, Scanarium coloring pages)} also directly in a graphics program on your computer and upload such colored files.

But we think that it's much more fun to color on real paper using real pens, crayons, or color.

Maybe someone of your friends has a printer and can print a few Scanarium color pages for you?

Or maybe you live close enough to a copy shop that offers low-cost printing?
