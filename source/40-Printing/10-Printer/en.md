# Is a normal printer enough?

Yes.
It'll will work with almost any printer.

Regardless of whether it is an inkjet or a laser printer.

Regardless of whether it is a multi-function printer or not.

As long as the {=macro(labeled-node-link, scanarium-coloring-pages, Scanarium coloring page)} printouts are {=macro(labeled-node-link, printing-tips, neither too light nor cut off)}, it should work just fine.
