# Uploading on a tablet/smartphone

Uploading images on a tablet/smartphone is really easy:

* {=macro(labeled-node-link, launching, Start your Scanarium)}
* Tap/click the screen
* Select "{=translate(Upload image)}"
* Then choose "Camera"
* Take a picture of your colored {=macro(labeled-node-link, scanarium-coloring-pages, Scanarium coloring page)}
* Tap the check-mark to confirm
* Done :-)

If you do not want to take a new picture, but instead want to upload an already existing image file from your device, use the {=macro(labeled-node-link, uploading-pc, instruction for uploading on a PC/laptop)}.
