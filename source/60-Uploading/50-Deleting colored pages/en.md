# Can I delete uploaded images again?

Yes, of course:

* Switch to the scene to delete images from.
* Tap/click the screen and choose "{=translate(Settings)}".
* Then choose the "{=translate(page_title, Administration)}" tab.
* In the section "{=translate(Delete actors)}", select "{=translate1Param(Reset scene "{scene_name}", scene_name, [â€¦])}" to delete all images from this scene.
* Confirm that you really want to reset the scene in the pop-up dialog.

Now all your images are deleted from the scene and you start afresh.
