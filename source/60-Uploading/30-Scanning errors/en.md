# Uploading does not work!

Simply click the "{=translate(Online Help)}" button underneath the error message in Scanarium.
That will open the help page for exactly the problem you're facing.

If the error message and the button are off the screen already, simply re-upload your image again.

You can find a list of error messages in the {=macro(labeled-node-link, errors, appendix)}.

In general, it's important to take care that

* you use only {=macro(labeled-node-link, scanarium-coloring-pages, Scanarium coloring pages)},

    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Foreign coloring page, images/scanning-foreign-page.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Good image of a Scanarium coloring page, images/scanning-ok.jpg)}
{: class=clearfix}

* the image is evenly and well lit (neither too dark and no hard shadows),

    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Image too dark, images/scanning-too-dark.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Image contains hard shadows, images/scanning-hard-shadows.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Evenly and well lit image, images/scanning-ok.jpg)}
{: class=clearfix}

* the image is not too shaky,

    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Too shaky, images/scanning-too-blurry.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Steady image, images/scanning-ok.jpg)}
{: class=clearfix}

* the {=macro(labeled-node-link, qr-code, QR code)} is well visible (neither occluded nor painted over),

    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, QR code is occluded, images/scanning-object-on-qr.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, QR code has been painted over, images/scanning-color-on-qr.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, QR code is well visible, images/scanning-ok.jpg)}
{: class=clearfix}

* the {=macro(labeled-node-link, rectangle, black bounding rectangle)} is fully in the image (neither cut off nor occluded).

    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Black bounding rectangle is cut off at the top, images/scanning-rectangle-cut-off.jpg)}
    {=macro(zoomable-image-left, Black bounding rectangle is fully visible, images/scanning-ok.jpg)}
{: class=clearfix}

If the uploading still does not work, please send us the image to {=macro(help-email-link)}
