# Uploading

You can upload {=macro(labeled-node-link, takepicture, images)} of colored {=macro(labeled-node-link, scanarium-coloring-pages, Scanarium coloring pages)} directly into Scanarium (Instructions: {=macro(labeled-node-link, uploading-tablet, tablet/smartphone)}, {=macro(labeled-node-link, uploading-pc, PC/laptop)}).

{=macro(labeled-node-link, save, Your uploaded images get stored)}.
So they are still available if you turn Scanarium off and later continue to play.

But you can of course also {=macro(labeled-node-link, delete, delete)} them.
