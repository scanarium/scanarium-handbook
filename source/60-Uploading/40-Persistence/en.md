# Will uploaded images still be there when I play next time?

Yes, your images get stored.

They are still there the next time you play.

Your newest images get shown the most.
But older images get mixed in as well.
So from time to time, you get to see even the first images you uploaded.

Of course you can also {=macro(labeled-node-link, delete, delete)} your images, if you want them gone for good.
